            <h2>About us and What we do</h2>
            <p>Aussie Kidz Charity assists the families of children under the age of 18 years old that are
                diagnosed with a disability.<br><br>After years of supporting various well known kids charities,
                Aussie Kidz Charity was started in early 2000 by a group of individuals disheartened by
                watching an increasing percentage of donations being used to cover overheads instead of
                going to the ones who need it most, the Kids.<br><br>
                With Aussie Kidz Charity, 100% of the donations received are used for the children,
                with the running costs and overheads kept to an absolute minimum and looked after
                by the Directors and friends.<br><br>
                Since starting, we have raised over $750,000 and have provided over 150 grants
                covering mobility aids, walking frames, specialised clothing and other assistance
                to these very special kids.<br><br>
                We are focussing on gaining support and donations through the generosity of Directors,
                individuals, corporations, estate trusts and through various yearly fund raising activities.
                <br><br>
                These includes the Mercedes Benz Polo Championships held each September and a
                Brisbane Businessman’s lunch held each November.<br><br>
                Aussie Kidz Charity has received the Australian Taxation Office endorsement in May
                2001 to allow donations over $2 to be tax deductible.<br><br>
